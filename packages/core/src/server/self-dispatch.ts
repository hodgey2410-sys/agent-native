/**
 * Shared self-dispatch helper for the framework's serverless background-work
 * pattern: enqueue a unit of work to SQL, then fire a fresh HTTP POST back to
 * this same deployment so the work runs in its own function invocation (with
 * its own full timeout budget) instead of riding on the request that created
 * it.
 *
 * This is the single mechanism that makes background work portable across every
 * host Nitro deploys to:
 *   - Netlify Lambda / Vercel Functions / AWS Lambda — the dispatched request
 *     hits a fresh function with its own budget; no `waitUntil` needed.
 *   - Cloudflare Workers — same (and `waitUntil` still works as a belt-and-
 *     suspenders fallback where the in-process path is used).
 *   - Self-hosted / long-lived Node — the dispatch comes back as another
 *     request to the same process; each handler still runs to completion.
 *
 * Originally inlined in both `a2a/handlers.ts` (`resolveSelfBaseUrl` +
 * `fireProcessTaskDispatch`) and `integrations/webhook-handler.ts`
 * (`resolveBaseUrl` + the dispatch in `enqueueAndDispatch`). Extracted here so
 * A2A, integration webhooks, and Agent Teams sub-agents share one tested
 * implementation.
